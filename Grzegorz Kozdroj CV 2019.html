            <h2 class="right__header">Profile</h2>
            <p>Previously worked in factory, where robots produce contacts lenses. Wanted to learn more, do different thing, where quality and skills matter. I got interested in coding, my first lessons were on mobile app SoloLearn, since then I am completely hooked up</p>

            <h2 class="right__header">Projects</h2>
            <ul class="projects__list">

                <li><a href="https://github.com/GrzesiekKozdroj/gimball">Guild Ball wip</a></li>
                <li>wip. I decided to translate tabletop game into JavaScript canvas element, it still has a long way to go and there are no animations yet, but you can already move characters, they detect each other, can fight using influence and even play with ball, I need to add turn structure (as last element), polish interface finish left-over functionalities, and a bazillion other things, but its fun, allows me to use mathematic formulas to calculate simple things like distances on Cartesian plane, done using vanilla JavaScript, jQuery for event listeners and html canvas element</li>
                
                <li><a href="https://github.com/GrzesiekKozdroj/tic-tac-toe-5">Tic-Tac-Toe-5</a></li>
                <li>wip. Still needs final polishing, I also realised that I have an exploit which needs patching, I want this to be easily used on touchscreen devices. This is a simple tic-tac-toe I have played in primary school. Back then, once I realised this game has way too limited moves, so that when I grasped all the possible moves it is virtually impossible to loose, me and my class mates started to play a version where we had to place 5 in row and an entire paper parchment was the battleground</li>
                
                <li><a href="https://github.com/GrzesiekKozdroj/Sit-On-Chair-Web-Page">Sit On Chair</a></li>
